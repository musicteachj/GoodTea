				<p>The Good Tea Company of America, LLC is a beverage company that provides consumers a natural wholesome alternative to sodas and other chemically-laced (saturated) products.  The lack of nutrients in over processed foods and beverages show a need to examine and reevaluate the current state of the nutritional contents in foods.  Our mission is to improve, support and facilitate healthier consumption through natural products that compliment good living.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The idea for this company is the brainchild of founder V. Vaughn Robbins who took a tea recipe that her mother made for the family and begin serving it until it took wings of its own.  The next product was inspired by a recipe that her father used to make lemonade. From conception in 1994 to inception two years later, the products of the Good Tea Company of America are made from family recipes passed down through generations that bare the familyâ€™s stamp of approval. Testing of these products to the general public began in 1996, via vending at major gatherings that included festivals, conferences, and outdoor events.  Since that time, these beverages have grown in popularity and have become a highly sought after product.  Our customers are repeat buyers who are refreshingly surprised that natural products like ours are available.</p>
				<br>
				<p>We believe that everyone deserves a chance to be healthier.  Our products are not targeted to an elite group of naturalist or holistic practitioners, but will be available to any and all consumers within the marketplace.  Reasonably priced at local food establishments, our products are designed to give consumers a better taste.</p>
